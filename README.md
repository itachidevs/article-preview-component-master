## My process
I started with a bassic HTML structure. In this project I have used flex box layout to arrange the elements side by side. I used psuedo classes for the popup boxes
I find it very simple using flex box while using making cards.
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
- How we can use different psudo classes and bulding a small popup for a button.
- When it comes to buliding with position property it was little bit confusing but   you can achieve it once you are used to it.
  To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
<footer class="footer-desktop" id="footer-desktop">
        <p class="share">SHARE</p>
        <img src="/article-preview-component-master\images\icon-facebook.svg" alt="facebook-icon" class="icon">
        <img src="/article-preview-component-master\images\icon-twitter.svg" alt="twitter-icon" class="icon">
        <img src="/article-preview-component-master\images\icon-pinterest.svg" alt="pinterest-icon" class="icon">
        
      </footer>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
ooter-desktop {

        visibility: hidden;
        width: fit-content;
        background-color: var(--heading);
        padding: 20px;
        position: absolute;
        display: flex;
        z-index: 1;
        bottom: 42%;
        left: 50%;
        margin-left: 200px;
        gap: 1em;
    }

```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
const showPopup=()=>{
    footerDesktop.classList.toggle('show-pop-up')
}
shareBtnDesktop.addEventListener('click',showPopup)

```
